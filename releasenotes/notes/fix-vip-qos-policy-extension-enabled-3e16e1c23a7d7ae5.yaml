fixes:
  - Fixed an issue where trying to set a QoS policy on a VIP while the QoS
    extension is disabled would bring the load balancer to ERROR. Should the
    QoS extension be disabled, the API will now return HTTP 400 to the user.
  - Fixed an issue where setting a QoS policy on the VIP would bring the load
    balancer to ERROR when the QoS extension is enabled.
